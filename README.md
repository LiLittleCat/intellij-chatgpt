This Jetbrains IDEs plugin integrates [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [other third-party mirror websites](https://github.com/LiLittleCat/awesome-free-chatgpt) of ChatGPT into JetBrains IDEs,
providing a seamless experience for developers to interact with the ChatGPT AI model directly within their development environment.

JCEF is supported in IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 and later. See [JCEF](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/jcef.html) for more information.
